# Contributing to WDL

WDL is intended to be a community resource, and as such its usefulness depends entirely on our ability to assess and satisfy the needs of said community. To that end, we crave your feedback and welcome any contribution that you are willing to provide, whether it be in the form of syntax suggestions, feature requests, documentation help, or simply pointing out our ~~tyops~~ typos. All that we ask is that you agree to the following [contributor agreement](#contributor-agreement) and follow a [few guidelines](#how-to-contribute) to keep the process efficient and enjoyable for all.

Any ideas or suggestions I provide may be used by the community and may become part of the official WDL specification under the [BSD 3-clause license](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/blob/develop/LICENSE).

# How to contribute
## Contributions to the WDL specification and syntax 

WDL is a workflow language meant to be written and read by humans. In order to achieve this goal, we rely on actual humans to help keep us on the right course. If you are human and a WDL enthusiast (or even just a WDL curious), please join us in the [WDL developers forum](FIXME) for vigorous and occasionally pedantic debates over the finer points of WDL syntax. Help us refine existing features and design new ones toward our goal of making it ever easier to write elegant and powerful workflows with WDL. Note that you'll need to [register as a WDL developer](FIXME) to participate in this forum, but have no fear: there is no qualifying requirement and you'll get a shiny badge, so why not [do it now](FIXME)? Go ahead, we'll wait. pom pom pom... Ah, welcome back, fellow WDL developer. Nice badge, right? Alright, where were we... Ah yes, next stop: the toolkit.

## Contributions to the WDL toolkit/ecosystem

As WDL increases in popularity, we're seeing various people who are not us building [all sorts of tools](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/toolkit) to enhance the experience of working with WDL or platforms that support it. This is delightful! So if you've created (or are thinking of creating) something that plugs into the WDL ecosystem, we'd really love to hear about it and make it known to the community so everyone can benefit from your ingenuity. And if you need help refining your Thing, just let us know and we'll see what we can do to help you help us help everyone. 

## Contributions to the documentation, code, etc

Finally, it goes without saying (but let's say it anyway) that we heartily welcome any contribution to the contents of the [WDL Github repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl), whether it be to the [specification](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/blob/develop/SPEC.md), [example scripts](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/tree/develop/scripts), [syntax highlighters](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl/tree/develop/highlighters), or anything we haven't yet thought of that could feel at home there. 

To do this, first fork then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/wdl.git
    
Make your change, then push your changes to the fork and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

## Thank you!
